# NgRX Auto-Entity

Automatic entities for [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform)! Simplifying reactive state!

**NOTE: NgRX Auto-Entity is currently a _beta_ library. It is in flux as we continue to refine and
enhance it's functionality, identify and eliminate bugs, optimize it's performance. If you
find any errors in this documentation, or bugs within the library, please let us know!**

## What is it?

NgRX Auto-Entity aims to provide a seamless means of dealing with standard entity actions and
effects with minimal repetitive code requirements, while preserving the fundamental nature of
NgRX itself. This library is not a replacement for or alternative to NgRX. It works within the
standard paradigm that NgRX has set forth, making use of actions, reducers & effects like any
other NgRX application.

What Auto-Entity does do is provide a set of ready-made, generic actions for handling all of
the standard CRUD operations for entities, so you neither have to write nor generate any of that
code yourself. Auto-Entity generates **pre-fabricated facades** around NgRx and the store/state, providing
a cohesive, logical and simplified API into your state. Auto-Entity presents a flexible framework
that you may use in its entirety for all of your entity needs, or use piecemeal as necessary in
order to achieve your specific goals.

While it is not required and Auto-Entity is an entirely independent library that solely depends
on Angular and NgRX, Auto-Entity manages state in a manner that is compatible with @ngrx/entity
as well, in the event you wish to utilize some of the utilities from that library in your own
custom reducers.

# Dependencies

NgRx Auto-Entity currently depends on Angular 8, NgRx 8 and RxJs 6.
