# [0.3.0](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-auto-entity/compare/0.2.8...0.3.0) Beta (2019-11-26)

This release adds the `correlationId` property (defaulting to `uuid()`) to `EntityAction` which should help in tracking correlated actions.
Correlated actions are usually sets of request/success/failure actions, such as `Create`, `CreateSuccess`, and `CreateFailure`.

### Features

- **correlated actions:** Add `correlationId` property to `EntityAction` for tracking correlated actions.

### Package

- **dependencies:** Add peer dependency on [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4)

### Breaking Changes !!

- [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4) will need to be added to your `package.json` as a dependency

### Security Updates

- [handlebars](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-auto-entity/pull/82) bumped to 4.5.3

# [0.2.2](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-auto-entity/compare/0.2.1...0.2.2) Beta (2019-08-07)

This release focuses on reducing the intrinsic package size and total package+dependency size of
the library. Total library size is now ~10k or so smaller than before. Third party dependency on
changeCase, which included a lot of casing functionality this library did not directly require, has
been removed in favor of integrated case conversion code. Further size optimizations may be made
possible in the future with some additional internal restructuring.

For the most compatibility with future internal (but otherwise non-breaking) changes, make sure
you are importing from @briebug/ngrx-auto-entity and not from child paths within the library!

### Package

- **dependencies:** Remove direct dependency on changeCase, integrate functionality

### Features

- **utils:** Added a new `buildSelectorMap` utility function
- **utils:** Added a new `buildFacade` utility function

### Cleanup

- **operators:** Reduce duplication of code by pulling out error handling to function
- **utils:** Reduce duplication of code by pulling out selector map creation to function
- **actions:** Reduce duplication of code by moving common lines to EntityAction base type
- **actions:** Reduce duplication of code by moving entity action type checking into function

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-auto-entity/compare/0.1.1...0.2.0) Beta (2019-07-25)

This version introduces some fundamental changes to how NgRx Auto-Entity is initialized, additional
features and functionality, as well as some breaking changes to facade properties. Many of these changes
further reduce the already minimal boilerplate with Auto-Entity.

### Documentation

Extensive documentation, examples and a proper quickstart guide have been added to our [GitBook](https://briebug.gitbook.io/ngrx-auto-entity/).

### Platform Update

This release involves a major update to the minimum required Angular and NgRx versions. In order to leverage
updated functionality from both libraries, as well as begin phasing in improved use of TypeScript, both platforms
have been updated to the 8.x versions. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, however we do believe
the changes and future improvements allowed by making this change will be welcome.

 - **angular:** The required version of @angular has been bumped up to 8.0
 - **ngrx:** The required version of @ngrx has been bumped uop to 8.0

### Features

 - **module:** A new `.forRootNoEffects()` can be used instead of `.forRoot()` to disable auto-provisioning of all effects

### Bug Fixes
 - **module:** Implemented `.forRoot()` and `.forFeature()` calls on `NgrxAutoEntityModule` to fix broken support for lazy loaded modules
 - **effects:** Added missing effects for select/deselect actions to dispatch selected/deselected counterparts
 - **service:** Updated `NgrxAutoEntityService` to support aggregate Injector tree so that models/entity services in lazy loaded modules will be found by root entity service
 - **util:** Changed `interface ITModelType<TModel>` to a `type IModelType<TModel>` to better conform to TypeScript best practices

 ### Breaking Changes !!
  - **facade:** Updated facade base class to include a $ postfix on all streaming properties
